These are the officially recognised boundaries of suburbs (in cities and larger towns) and localities (outside cities and larger towns) as defined by the State and Territory governments of Australia.

There are two tables of permitted values available for use:

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics' mesh block-based approximations of the authoritative boundaries. This contains all Australian suburbs and localities.
* Landgate's authoritative set of suburbs and localities. This only contains Western Australian suburbs and localities.

The CSV and GeoPackage files here were created from the [official ASGS 2021 boundaries data files on abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files).

The ABS creates these boundaries to enable the release of data on areas that approximate the official boundaries. This allows for the comparison of ABS data with other data collected using suburbs and localities and may be used for statistical purposes.

As these are mesh block-based approximations of the authoritative boundaries, they do not exactly match the geographic extents of the authoritative boundaries. Caution should be exercised when using these boundaries in geographic analysis that requires a fine level of detail.
