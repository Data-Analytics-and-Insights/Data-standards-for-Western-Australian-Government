# Data standards for the Western Australian Government
These standards provide a guide for collecting data in Western Australian Government and are published by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. They enable a common approach to collecting data that is frequently used by agencies. This will promote consistency in the use of data which will support projects that improve client journeys and service development.

**Note:** As of November 2021 the standards are still in draft and are not yet endorsed. They will be subject to further changes as a result of consultation and feedback
